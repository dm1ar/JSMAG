This project demonstrates the feasibility of using LLM's, like ChatGPT, to generate fully functionally programs for the amateur radio community without writing the actual code. This is a fundamental paradigm shift and allows software to be generated by a simple, but complete, textual descriptions. However, each AI generated program requires
extensive testing and verification if all requirements are met.

This project is a web-based Morse Code Player. It allows users to input ASCII text, convert it to Morse code, and play it back as audio. The application includes features such as adjusting the frequency, speed, volume, and Farnsworth timing of the Morse code. Additionally, it provides reference tables for Morse code characters and prosigns.

The code was generated by ChatGPT-4o

## Features

- **Text Input**: Users can input ASCII text to be converted and played as Morse code.
- **Frequency Control**: Adjust the audio frequency between 500 Hz and 1200 Hz.
- **Speed Control**: Set the speed of Morse code playback between 5 WPM and 35 WPM.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the playback volume.
- **Farnsworth Timing**: Control the spacing between words using Farnsworth timing.
- **Prosigns Handling**: Special Morse code prosigns are handled correctly with appropriate timing.
- **File Upload**: Drag and drop a `.txt` file to load and play its content as Morse code.
- **Reference Tables**: Includes reference tables for Morse code characters (letters and numbers) and prosigns.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/morse-code-player.git
   cd morse-code-player
   ```

2. **Open the Application**:
   - Open `morse.html` in your web browser.

3. **Input Text**:
   - Type or paste ASCII text into the input area.

4. **Adjust Settings**:
   - Use the sliders to adjust frequency, speed, volume, and Farnsworth timing.

5. **Play Morse Code**:
   - Click the "Abspielen" button to play the Morse code.
   - Click "STOP" to stop playback.
   - Click "Endlos" to loop the playback until stopped.

6. **File Upload**:
   - Drag and drop a `.txt` file into the designated area to load its content.
