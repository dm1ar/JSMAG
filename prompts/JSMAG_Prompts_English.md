# Prompts for JSMAG

## Here you will find the prompts for starting creating the JSMAG program in English from zero

## Initialization

Create a program in JavaScript.  
Follow the Google JavaScript Style Guide.  
Include file headers with the author "Your Callsign," date, and license information (MIT License).  
Comment the code in English.  
Generate object-oriented code (OOP) with classes and methods.  
First, wait for the requirements.

## Program Creation
Create an interactive webpage "morse.html" with the page title "Morse Code Player" (bold, centered) with a light blue background in the browser to convert ASCII input into Morse code and play it as audio. Use the ITU Morse code table with punctuation marks and prosigns.  
Create a stylesheet "styles.css" and a code file "script.js" in OOP.  
Create a centered input field in light yellow at the top for an ASCII string of 5 lines, 80 characters wide.  
Below it, create a green play button and a red STOP button.  
Below that, create a slider (80 characters wide) to select the tone frequency from 500 Hz to 1200 Hz in 10 Hz steps. Use 750 Hz as the default.  
Below the frequency slider, create another slider to select the Morse speed between 5 WPM and 35 WPM with 20 WPM as the default and steps of 1 WPM.

## Troubleshooting
Correct the timing.  
Pause between symbols is one "dit".  
Pause between characters is 3 "dit".  
Pause between words (one or more spaces) is 7 "dit".



## Continue to add features and remove bugs with your own prompts



# Working from the "main" or "development" branch

If you add features or remove bugs from the existing code base on Github you must upload the complete code base first to ChatGPT or CoPilot.

Then you can prompt for specific actions.

# Creating Class Diagramms

For creating a class diagram to document the code, ask ChatGPT to produce a class diagram in Mermaid. Past and copy it into the Mermaid Live Editor <https://mermaid.live>
